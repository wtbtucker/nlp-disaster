# Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one's aren't. This sentiment classification task is important for helping first responders and news organizations detect and respond to real disasters quickly. The data is obtained from a Kaggle competition. I use natural language processing to clean the text data then compare GRU and LSTM models' performance.
